# AWS HPC Platform

Welcome to the AWS HPC Platform documentation! This platform provides a flexible, application-agnostic infrastructure for deploying high-performance computing applications on AWS with architecture-optimized containers and cost-efficient job scheduling.

## Overview

AWS HPC Platform is designed to make running computational workloads on AWS simple, cost-effective, and performant. Whether you're running atmospheric simulations, quantum chemistry calculations, or machine learning training, the platform handles the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on your science.

### Key Features

- **üèóÔ∏è Application-Agnostic Platform**: Add new scientific applications without changing infrastructure code
- **‚ö° Architecture-Optimized**: Automatic builds for AMD EPYC, Intel, and ARM Graviton with processor-specific optimizations
- **üí∞ Cost-Optimized**: Spot instances, priority queues, and automatic architecture selection for best price/performance
- **üì¶ Layered Containers**: Reusable base images with compilers and libraries, fast application builds
- **üîß Single-Node & MPI**: Support for OpenMP (single-node) and MPI (multi-node) workloads
- **üéØ Simple Job Submission**: Submit jobs via CLI without AWS console knowledge
- **üìä Cost Tracking**: Built-in cost estimation and tracking per job

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install CLI
brew install aws-hpc  # or download from releases

# Deploy an application
aws-hpc app deploy geos-chem --env benchmark

# Submit a job
aws-hpc job submit geos-chem \
  --config benchmark.yaml \
  --architecture c7a \
  --output s3://my-bucket/results/

# Monitor job
aws-hpc job status <job-id>
```

## Why AWS HPC Platform?

### For Researchers

- **Focus on Science**: Simple job submission without learning AWS infrastructure
- **Cost Visibility**: Know how much your simulation will cost before running it
- **Performance**: Architecture-optimized builds deliver 2-3x better performance than generic containers
- **Flexibility**: Run on-demand or spot instances, choose any AWS region

### For Labs and Research Groups

- **Multi-User Support**: Cost allocation per user and project
- **License Management**: Built-in FlexLM and RLM integration
- **Reproducibility**: Container-based workloads ensure consistent results
- **Governance**: Centralized deployment with access controls

### For HPC Engineers

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Deploy via CDK/Terraform
- **Extensibility**: Add applications without platform changes
- **Security**: Private subnets, VPC endpoints, encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch integration, cost tracking, job telemetry

## Platform Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Platform (infrastructure) and Applications (science) are independent
2. **Versioning Independence**: Platform and applications version separately
3. **Container Layering**: Shared base images across applications
4. **Cost Transparency**: Always show estimated and actual costs
5. **Security by Default**: Private networking, encryption, least-privilege IAM

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v0.1.0-alpha
**Status**: üöß Active Development

The platform is being extracted from the [aws-geos-chem](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-geos-chem) project to create a reusable foundation for multiple scientific applications.

### What's Working

- ‚úÖ Core platform architecture defined
- ‚úÖ GEOS-Chem application extraction in progress
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture container builds
- ‚úÖ AWS Batch integration patterns

### Coming Soon

- üöß CLI tool (`aws-hpc`)
- üöß GEOS-Chem application plugin complete
- üìã Additional applications (Gaussian, WRF)
- üìã Web dashboard
- üìã Cost tracking system

See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/aws-hpc/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for detailed plans.
